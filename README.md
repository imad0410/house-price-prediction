# House Price Prediction using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and more. The dataset used is based on the Boston Housing dataset, which has been modified for the purposes of this project.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict house prices using machine learning with a neural network.
- **Dataset**: The project uses the Boston Housing dataset with 13 features related to housing characteristics.
- **Model**: A neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features Used

- Crime rate (`crim`)
- Proportion of residential land zoned (`zn`)
- Industrial proportion (`indus`)
- Number of rooms (`rm`)
- Property tax rate (`tax`)
- And other relevant features...

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Joblib

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
